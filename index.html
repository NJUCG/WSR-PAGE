                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                            In the context of hardware-accelerated real-time ray tracing, existing spatiotemporal resampling techniques
                            are still constrained by screen-space dependencies, which may lead to reuse failures. To address this issue,
                            we propose a world-space resampling method based on a hybrid spatial structure that combines uniform grids
                            and octrees. This persistent structure, which remains unchanged with respect to camera motion, can
                            efficiently partition scenes while preserving geometric details.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                            Our method begins with generating initial light samples, then remaps these samples to the spatial structure.
                            Spatial reuse occurs entirely within individual spatial nodes. For direct illumination, we determine the
                            spatial node of each shading point and select the world-space reservoir from that node to obtain a light
                            sample. For indirect illumination, we trace a BRDF ray and use the world-space reservoir within the spatial
                            node at the hit point to improve the NEE. This unified approach enables joint sample reuse for both direct
                            and indirect illumination.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                            Our experiments show that the proposed method achieves 20-70% reduction in RelMSE compared to screen-space
                            ReSTIR and previous world-space methods under equal-time comparison, with 2× faster convergence rates and
                            superior temporal stability under rapid camera motion.
